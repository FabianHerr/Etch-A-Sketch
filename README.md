# Etch-A-Sketch

## Overview

This exercise is a simple implementation of an **Etch-A-Sketch** tool using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to draw on a grid of squares, change the grid's size dynamically, and clear the drawing.

The grid size can be adjusted by entering an integer between 1 and 100, and the drawing area can be reset with a button. The grid is interactive, and the background color of each square changes as the user moves the mouse over it.
